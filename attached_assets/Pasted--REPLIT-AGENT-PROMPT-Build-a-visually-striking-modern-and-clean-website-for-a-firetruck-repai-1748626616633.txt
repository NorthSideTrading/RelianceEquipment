🚨 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 🚨
Build a visually striking, modern, and clean website for a firetruck repair and maintenance business called Reliance Equipment.

🛠 GENERAL SITE STRUCTURE
Three main pages: Home, Services, and About

Clean, professional layout using a fire/rescue-themed color scheme: deep red, black, chrome/silver, and white

Subtle but unique visual touches: icons, SVGs, or animations related to mechanical repair, firetrucks, and tools (e.g. gears turning, hose nozzle icons, firetruck silhouette line art)

Font style should feel industrial yet approachable — bold headers, clean sans-serif body text

Responsive design for desktop and mobile

🧭 NAVIGATION
Create a sticky header with the brand name/logo on the left and nav links: Home | Services | About on the right. Add a “Contact Us” call-to-action button.
